# Social-Media-Data-Analysis

The objective of this project is to analyze posts (or other social media data) and gain insights into user engagement. We will explore the data set using visualization techniques to understand the distribution of likes across different categories. Finally, we will analyze the data to draw conclusions about the most popular categories and the overall engagement on the platform.
